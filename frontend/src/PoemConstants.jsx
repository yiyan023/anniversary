`i love resting my head on your shoulder 
finding your heart beats in time with mine
holding hands, a complete puzzle.
we fit together perfectly, you and i 
Maybe god made us that way?`,
me: 
`I still remember the first time I put my 
head on your shoulder. We were in grade 12,
sitting on a park bench and enjoying 
each other’s company. Despite being 
something so mundane, I still remember 
my heart racing as if it happened yesterday.
You’ve always made me feel some type of way.`
},
"2": {
emily: 
`silent phone calls late at night as we drift asleep.
you are far away, i know, but you feel so close,
your deep breath and soft voice take me away 
to a place where i am holding you as we sleep.
it’s a dream i hope will soon become a reality.`,
me:
`I love how we can spend hours 
together every night – talking, 
playing or absolutely nothing. 
I could stare at you for hours`

emily: 
`the wind dances through our hair 
as we take a road trip through life. 
we’re not sure where we are going,
but we are happy to be together.`,
me:
`Regardless of whether 
we live in a mansion,
a shack, or in a homeless 
shelter, I know I’m happy 
as long as I have you.`

emily: 
`jump rope in elementary school,
truth-or-dare in elementary school,
holding hands in high school.
it’s not how it was, but it feels like it:
like i have known you forever.`,
me:
`I can’t remember 
what life feels like 
without you anymore.
I hope I never do.
You’ve made it better 
in every possible way.`
},
"5": {
emily: 
`maybe we were meant to be,
maybe not. 
it doesn’t matter 
as long as you are with me`,
me:
`Correction: we are meant to be. 
I’ve never felt so sure about anything 
before, because you’re the one for me.`
},
"6": {
emily: 
`the silence is loud between us. we aren’t talking. we 
aren’t even looking at or touching each other. still, 
the love is loud. the love between us fills the silence. 
maybe it’s magic. maybe it’s just my imagination. i 
don’t know. all i know is that it feels right
it feels right.
`,
me:
`I love how safe I feel 
whenever I’m with you. 
We could be doing absolutely nothing, 
and yet it feels like everything.`

emily: 
`every time i cried in your arms, every time you 
made me laugh, every time you knew i needed a hug 
when i didn’t say so, every time you should have 
been angry at me but weren’t – how do you love me 
so much? every time i fail, you are there to pick 
me up. every time i win, you are there to celebrate 
with me. every time i am sad, you are there to sit 
in the sadness with me. every time, you are there. 
every. time.`,
me:
`Watching you love me 
has taught me how to love myself.`
},
"8": {
emily: 
`i love your laugh. i love the whispered i love you 
that always comes after. i love your smile. i love 
the kiss that follows. i love your quippy little 
remarks that make me laugh. i love that we are 
friends. we are friends before we are lovers. we 
were friends before we fell in love, too.
it’s how it’s meant to be, i think.`,
me:
`I think you’re perfect.
You’re everything I’ve ever wanted.`
},
"9": {
emily: 
`a movie drones on in the background, but i am not 
paying attention. i am looking at you. you are 
beautiful. you are the most important person in my 
life. i would die for you. i will live for you. i 
love you more than i knew it was possible to love 
someone. it’s you, as it has always been.`,
me:

and everything becomes right again `,

your company doesn’t solve.`

emily: 
`sharing our last pennies for a milkshake;
you get the left headphone, i get the right.
a mixed playlist of yours and mine plays.
my shoes are worn down, your hat has a hole.
we don’t care, though. we are happy as is.`,
me:
`When I picture my future, 
happiness comes from you
and only you.`

"12": {
emily: 
`we whisper during movies. we laugh over inside jokes.
we sing off-key on purpose. we have a secret language.
we eat too much takeout. we share everything we can.
we are best friends and lovers. we are perfectly imperfect. 
we are how i want to be forever.`,
me:
`I still remember that one night in Kingston 
where we spent hours trying to figure out 
why Steel-type Pokemon are immune to Poison-type Pokemon. 
I love how we can spend hours talking and laughing about anything. 
These moments never go unnoticed.`

emily: 
`in our corner of heaven,
there’s a place
where we snuggle up
under a blanket of clouds,
to discuss everything in the world.
it’s our private sanctuary,
away from 
those who can’t understand, 
why our two hearts,
beat as one.`,
me:
`You are my diary, my home, 
and my friend all in one. 
There is no one else 
who understands me 
like you do.`

one full of smiles and laughter,
dancing in our kitchen,
singing down the highway,
living life together.`,

`how do i explain our love to someone else?
how could i explain rain to someone who’s not seen 
it? how could i explain warmth to someone who’s not 
felt it? how could i explain our love?`,
me:
`I don’t think I could. 
There are no words that 
describe how lucky I feel to be 
with someone like you`

emily: 
`i love you.
not in the way i love the partners in my life,
but in the way i love that one song, you know?
i can play it over and over again, forever,
yet still hear something new each time.
maybe it is the love i have for artwork,
musing over it for hours in awe.
i love you like that.

I’m always excited to see you, 
even if it's after an hour, a week, 
or a month apart.`

through your darkest hours,
through your hardest days, 
through your quietest battles–
i’m here. i’ll always be here.
just say the word,

i love you.`,
